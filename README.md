# Organization Project - Single Processor Design Control Unit

Welcome to the **Organization Project**! This repository focuses on the design of a **Single Processor Control Unit**.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project involves the design of a control unit for a **single processor system**. The control unit is responsible for managing the operations of the processor, interpreting instructions, and coordinating the execution of tasks within the processor. The project is an essential step in understanding the architecture and functionality of digital systems.

## 🔧 Technologies Used:
- **Verilog HDL** for hardware design
- **Simulation Tools**: Compatible with Verilog simulators like ModelSim or any preferred Verilog simulation software

## 🚀 Features:
- **Control Unit Design**: Design of the control unit for single processor operation.
- **Instruction Decoding**: Implementation of a mechanism to decode instructions and manage data flow.
- **Simulation**: Testing the control unit’s functionality using various input scenarios to ensure proper operation.

## 🛠️ How to Use:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Verilog files in your preferred Verilog simulator (e.g., ModelSim).
3. Simulate and verify the control unit’s behavior with the provided test cases.

## ⚙️ Structure:
- `src/` - Verilog code for the control unit design.
- `tests/` - Testbenches and simulation results.

## 📈 Testing:
Testbenches have been created to validate the functionality of the control unit. You can run the simulations to verify correct behavior for different instructions and scenarios.
